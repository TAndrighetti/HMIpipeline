Data used and description

DESCRIPTION : Performs disordered region based filtering of motifs predicted  to be involved in the domain-motif interactions inferred in the previous step. 

A. Input files : 

1. 16591 interactions between microbial and host proteins predicted by DMI script;
see MPDMIresult.tsv in "resources" folder

2. human receptor protein sequences ; downloaded from Uniprot by the script idr_prediction.py
and stored in the folder "protein_sequences"

B. Script :

Main script idr_prediction.py which calls the actual IUPRED script iupred2a.py

C. Output files : 

1. IUPRED filtered results stored in "idr_motifs.csv" in the "results" folder and contains 2098 interactions between microbial and host proteins
